</div></div><p>            My name is Ana Elisa Barioni. I am a PhD student of the Physics and Astronomy department in the Motter's group. I am originally from Brazil and it has always been my dream to study abroad and pursue an academic career as a researcher. I am very much looking forward to moving to the Evanston/Chicago area since I've heard that this is a beautiful place to live with a lot of exciting things to do and to learn. I have also learned a lot from the Northwestern University as I search on the internet. Knowing more about the campus, the resources, and the students, specially from my research group, makes me even more excited to go. 
At the same time that I am excited, I'm still nervous to start this new journey in my life. I've never been in a foreign country for such a long time before. My family is also nervous about this long time distance, but we will keep in touch through zoom calls and social media. They are also excited to visit Chicago and meet my new house and way of life. In summary, I'm looking forward to start this amazing adventure and do my best with this opportunity.</p></article>

	<h2><a id="Yi-ping Chen">Yi-ping Chen</a></h2>
</div></div><p>I’m Yi-Ping Chen from Taiwan, and I am starting my Ph.D. study at the Department of Mechanical Engineering this fall. I grew up in Kaohsiung, a southern city in Taiwan, which owns the 4th large harbor in the world. Aside from Kaohsiung, I also lived in Tainan while purchasing my bachelor's degree, and in Taipei for my master’s degree. Moreover, I stayed in Taichung for more than a year for work. I’m glad that I could get familiar with these four major cities in Taiwan and enjoy their beauty. I believe these experiences provide me a variety of materials to introduce my home town to my foreign friends and offer me the confidence to be a great host of my home town for hospitality.
During my Ph.D., I’ll focus on designing mechanical systems by considering the various source of uncertainties to mitigate the risk during operations and improve the overall robustness and reliability of our design objectives. This issue is gaining increasing attention for engineering design/decision/optimization nowadays relies more on computer models. Therefore, the domain knowledge of “Design Under Uncertainty” undoubtedly plays a crucial role in modern engineering and decision-making. To me, not only do the promising and broad applications of the related tools fascinate me but also the Design Society always emphasizes the value of making a better world by addressing the most critical socio-technical issues. That’s why I’m excited to contribute my intelligence to support this value, making engineering more than just engineering.
Aside from my research, I enjoy building interpersonal relationships and watching hilarious movies/sitcoms. In my opinion, making friends with different people is like reading books, and I can always feel my mind and horizon be broadened during the relationship. Watching sitcoms, to me, is another way to enjoy a relationship. When I watch the Big Bang Theory and How I Met Your Mother, it feels like the characters are my friends and we live together and share our lives. Therefore, I can obtain a great sense of belonging in these activities.
Since I and my wife (an F2 dependent) cannot imagine how the life will be like in Evanston, we’re quite nervous but looking forward to starting our new life there. We hope we could make friends with people over there and won’t feel bored and isolated. Last but not least, we’re planning to raise children during the study years.

I'm going to pursue my Ph.D. in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and I'm in the group called Transportation systems analysis and planning. My research interests include transportation planning and travel behavior. I'm especially interested in topics related to sustainability and urban resilience. I aspire to study people's decision-making behavior toward emerging transportation services and explore strategies for future transportation planning and operations. 
In my free time, I like listening to music and watching movies and series. My favorite singer is Taylor Swift, and I also listen to Japanese rock music. I watch all types of films, except for horror movies. In addition, I've been watching Stranger Things recently because Season 4 is now on Netflix! However, it has been a long time since the last time I watched it. I almost forgot what happened in previous seasons, so I'm reviewing Season 1-3 now. I also like cooking, although I'm still practicing how to cook. Painting is my new hobby, and I like to paint landscapes. Furthermore, I love to travel and try cuisine from different countries. My favorite country is Japan, and I have been there six times. I take lots of pictures during my trips, and I'd say photography is one of my hobbies. 
I'm looking forward to having a walk/run along Lake Michigan and learning more about the architecture in Chicago. Meeting new people is what I'm most excited about at Northwestern, and it's also what I'm nervous about. Nice to meet you!

</div></div><p>Hi everybody! 
My name is Catalina Farías and I am from Santiago, Chile. I was born and raised in Santiago and I continue living here. I have a BA in Social Communication and I will be studying in the School of Communication in the Media, Technology and Society (MTS) PhD program. My research interests are digital inclusion and digital inequalities. Specifically I’ve been studying how people adopt and use technology, the digital divide that exists between different sectors of society (e.g. gender inequalities, rural and urban areas, educational level, age), and how this influences the development of digital skills. My other research area is digital activism and message effects on digital environments and their influence on civic engagement.
I am really excited to start the program and get to know Evanston, Chicago (I always wanted to visit the city), and the campus!</p></article>

</div></div><p>Hello, everyone! My name is Haiqing Gao. I'm from China, Guizhou Province. I will study in the Industrial Engineering and Management Science department. It's really nice to meet you, and I hope that we can become good friends. 
My research interest is applying optimization methods to solve healthcare problems. For example, I have designed an algorithm to promote mobile health interventions. The project aims to utilize wearable devices, such as iWacth, to provide patients with timely suggestions. In China, insufficient healthcare resources cause conflicts between patients and doctors, so I hope I can design an algorithm that is feasible in real applications to release the burden on doctors in the future. 
As for my personal interest, I love reading fiction, watching animations and TV series, and doing sports, and I am willing to try new things. For the reading, I read detective fiction most of the time. My favorite author is Agatha Christie. Her stories have been adapted for movies and TV series uncountable times, such as the Murder on the Orient Express. I also enjoy science fiction because it combines imagination and logical deduction based on facts. For the animations and TV series, I watch those with fancy stories or vivid characters. Since I have watched many animations and Korean TV series, I can understand part of Japanese and Korean. I plan to learn deeper in Japanese later. Moreover, those animations and televisions inspire me to explore different cultures. Therefore, I am thrilled to listen to your culture in your hometown if you want to share it with me. For sports, I like swimming, doing Pamela and running. Besides them, I can play badminton, tennis, basketball, frisbee, and volleyball (though not very well). Exercising helps me maintain a healthy body as well as a good mood. Though Ph.D. study can be really time demanding, I think keeping enough exercise is quite crucial.
There are two things that I am most excited about living in Evanston: snow and my own room. My home and university are in the South area, so it's scarce to see the snow. I can't wait to ski and skate at Evanston in winter! Furthermore, it's the first time that I will rent a house outside the school, furnishing the room on my own, and need not share my room with my roommates. How excited I am!

</div></div><p>Hi everyone, I'm Fatima Gaw. I'm an incoming PhD student of the Media, Technology and Society (MTS) program.I am from the Philippines, but I have moved to Australia for two years for my master's degree. I got back in 2020 (pandemic year!) to teach and do research.
I have been in the academe professionally for 2.5 years years now, working as an Assistant Professor at the University of the Philippines. My research interests center on the mediation of platforms, networks and algorithms in political, culture and discourse. My recent works have been around election discourses and disinformation (see my latest analysis (Links to an external site.)), from the election of populist leader Rodrigo Duterte in 2016 to the election of the son of the dictator Bongbong Marcos Jr. to office just last May.I'm looking forward to living in Chicago because I heard it hits the sweet spot between a busy city and a laid back culture. I truly need some slower pace in my life. Northwestern is also the best place for me to do my research as it is has one of the best Comm and media departments in the world. The labs are so cool on paper, they might be much more amazing IRL!The only thing I'm nervous about is bringing my dog with me from Manila to Chicago. There's too many papers to process (more than my own visa!) so I'm hoping for the best results for me and him.Cheers, hope to see you all soon.

</div></div><p>I was admitted to the Managerial Economics and Strategy Ph.D. program at the Kellogg School of Management.
I was born in Brazil, and I lived here all my life, but for a brief single-term study abroad program at Rice University in Houston. My family lives in a small city in the state of São Paulo, and that is where I lived until I went to college in the city of São Paulo. I graduated in Economics from the University of São Paulo and soon after I joined FGV's São Paulo School of Economics to pursue my Master's degree.
During these years, I became interested in applied economic theory, especially in the applications to political economy. In other words, I am interested in applying Economics' theoretical framework to study political situations. In this theme, one topic that captivates me is the study of conflicts, as studying military history has been one of my hobbies.
Academical interests aside, I am also into cooking and manual crafts such as calligraphy and, more recently, bookbinding. 
What I most look forward to once I move to Evanston is coming back to an in-person academic environment. The conversations and free exchange of ideas face to face is the part I miss the most from the pre-pandemic period.
Right now my only source of anxiety has been finding a roommate and renting a place to live. </p></article>

I'm a student in the 2022 fall IBiS program (Interdisciplinary Biological Sciences Graduate Program, you can consider it as a general biology Ph.D. program). I think I will study neuroscience in this department. I'll come to Evanston in early August. 
I was born and raised in Shanghai, China, where I spent most of my life. This is a beautiful city with countless delicious food from all over the world, though I'm not quite into its weather :P (rains and winds a lot). I'll graduate from Fudan University this year in June. I can say my undergrad life is filled with self-improvement and freedom and chilliness. I do love the school.
I will call myself a girl like a spirit (if it doesn't sound too narcissistic). My MBTI is ENFP. I'm full of energy and ready to make new friends! For sports, I love swimming and working out (mainly following KEEP). I love American and Japanese TV series, and my favorites are Person of Interest and Unnatural Death (for now). I like Cardi B's and Yonezu Kenshi's songs. I go to musicals sometimes, mainly English or French. I love cats and planning to keep one in Evanston! 
I've attached my Wechat and Instagram QR codes. Please please do not hesitate to contact me! We can chat about our interests and our future life in Chicago. Also do not hesitate to grab food or hang out with me!

Greetings! I'm Motahareh Hakiminejad (Moti for short) from Tehran, Iran. 

Department of Study: I will be a student in the Interdisciplinary Biological Sciences (IBiS) Ph.D. program, an interdisciplinary program with faculty from five departments.
Country of Origin: I was born in Kashan, a historical city, and raised in Tehran, the capital of Iran.
Profile: I am a biologist, and I love studying the intricate, complex, and beautiful machinery of living beings through computational methods. For my master thesis, I developed a machine learning tool to identify driver mutations based on the effect of mutation on protein. I play Tar, an Iranian string instrument, go hiking or birdwatching, or make some crafts in my spare time. 
I'm an outdoorsy person and love being in nature, so I love the natural sights of Evanston. The fact that Chicago is nearby is incredible, allowing you to have the hustle and bustle of a big city and the calm of a small town. I look forward to making many new friends and having new experiences!

I enjoy meeting new people, so feel free to contact me. I am available by email (mot.hakimi.95@gmail.com). I'm also on Twitter (https://twitter.com/MotHakimi (Links to an external site.)) and LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/motahareh-hakiminejad-7840471b7/ (Links to an external site.)).</p></article>

</div></div><p>My name is Thayane Henriques, a Brazilian girl from Rio de Janeiro who is going to start a Ph.D. in Media, Technology, and Society in the Communication Department at Northwestern this fall.
At the doctoral level, my interests are Fan studies, Mainstream Media, Digital Media, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Social Justice, Online Participation and Inequality, and Social Media. I want to investigate how a mainstream “feminist-oriented” product, like a TV show, addresses gender issues and depicts women. At the same time, examine how this content influences fans’ engagement with feminism and other social movements and affects their identities. For that, it would be interesting to explore fans’ behavior on social media, like Twitter, and their original content-creation, like fan videos. Fruitful questions could emerge: If a product reinforces stereotypes about feminism, do fans renegotiate these conceptions on social media? Do fans create content to engage with other minority social fights? How does the gender portrayal of a mainstream product affect girls’ self-perception? What strategies do activist fans use to spread their content on digital platforms? Can exposure to offensive messages lead to collective action by fans of minority groups? I recognize that mainstream media sometimes can be harmful by inadvertently perpetuating sexist and misogynistic depictions, and fans could be a potent social group that refuses prevailing gender ideas. About my personal interests, I am crazy about watching k-dramas and going to the movies. I also enjoy going to the beach on weekends.
I believe Chicago and Evanston are fantastic cities to live in. I am thrilled to go to Northwestern but also anxious, especially because of Chicago’s weather. As I am from Rio, I am used to sunny and hot days. I am sure it will be hard to face Chicago’s Winter. Besides, I am very closed to my family. For sure, I will miss them very much.</p></article>

Hi, I'm Hyerim Hong.
I'm from Seoul, South Korea, where I spent most of my life. I have traveled to the United States and Spain among other places and have pleasant memories of each of them. I hope to make new great memories in Evanston for the next five years.
I will be doing my doctorate in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, where I would be studying contemporary theater in Spanish-speaking countries, especially Spain. My research interests include immigrant narratives, ethical issues in representation, testimonio, and documentary theater. These interests stemmed from my personal passion for theater and from my concern for contributing to society.
I'm very excited to be joining the Northwestern University community. I have heard great things about the community, such as how kind and cooperative people generally are and the supportive atmosphere it has. I'm also looking forward to living in Evanston and in close distance from Chicago, as I have always wanted to enjoy the suburbs' tranquility as well as the vibrant city life. I would love to see the lake and all the greenery in Evanston. I've never been to Chicago, but I've been told that it has great art, theater, and culture, which I won't miss out. 
There is one thing I am worried about living in Evanston: the cold. I can't stand cold weather and I've heard that winter in Illinois is very long and quite extreme. People on the Internet give bits of advice to wear layers and to put on waterproof boots and coats, but honestly, I'm not sure if that would be enough for me to keep myself warm. However, I won't let the cold hold me back from enjoying my time in Evanston. I'm sure I'll figure out my own ways to cope with the cold eventually.
I look forward to making new friends and experiencing new cultures at Northwestern University and in Evanston!</p></article>

</div></div><p>Hi, everyone! I am Kaiwen, an incoming PhD student in the Screen Cultures program, Department of Radio/TV/Film, School of Communication. 
I was born and raised in Guiyang, a mountainous town in Southwest China. I have lived in other Chinese cities including Tianjin and Guangzhou, and I have spent a year studying in London, United Kingdom.
My research explores the changing notions of screens – pre-cinematic spectacles, contemporary world cinemas, and new/alternative media – and how they intervene in our lifeworld. My other interests span the topics of hip-hop and R&B music, K-pop girl groups, Japanese anime, video game livestreaming, Youtube, and “pop cultures” in general. My favorite writers are Jorge Luis Borges, Italo Calvino, and Umberto Eco. I go swimming in my spare time and I watch European football games. 
I look forward to advancing my study in Evanston because I plan to be a visual culture researcher and college professor in the future. And I hope to make friends in and out of my interested areas and broaden my horizons. I am both exited and nervous about my upcoming Evanston living experience because this will be my first time to the US. Having been exposed to a lot of (often biased and self-contradicted) media coverage about the US in China, I wish to see for myself this time.

</div></div><p>Hello, Everyone.
I am Arushi Kapoor and I am excited to have been accepted at the CEE (Civil and Environmental Engineering) department at Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering at Northwestern University.
I currently reside in Delhi, India. During my formative years, I had the opportunity to live and learn about diverse cultures across India and imbibe the good elements of each of them. I grew up in six different states and found myself being more open to people with diverse cultural backgrounds and different languages. These experiences have shaped my ability to adjust quickly to the ever-changing environment.
I completed my undergraduate degree in Medical Biotechnology and Master’s degree in Biotechnology from Amity University, India. I believe that biotechnology is the backbone for all innovations in the field of life sciences. Microbiology, bioremediation, and environmental sciences can help in the development of bio-engineered solutions to the humungous problems we face today, and being a part of the solution is of keen interest to me.
Beyond the realm of academics, my extracurricular interests include biking and hiking. I am keen to explore and join groups to give wings to my interests. Given my proclivity to explore the world, I enjoy learning new languages and experiencing new cultures. My hobbies help me align with nature to gain new experiences and appreciate diversity.
I look forward to living and exploring Evanston and Chicago. As a most sought-after seat for global learning, I expect it to be an opportunity to meet and engage with the larger global community, understand their perspectives, appreciate diversity, experience cuisine, and festivals, make friends and become a part of a global community.
Among the many reasons for joining Northwestern University are the diverse topics and projects currently being researched and the many opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. The faculty, facilities, and research opportunities offered at Northwestern University are unmatched.
Though I have traveled out of India for holidays in the past, I have not had the opportunity to visit the United States of America till now. So this is both exciting and daunting as I will be moving away from family for an extended period.

I am about to complete my undergrad in University of Cyprus, where I majored in Economics and minored in Mathematics, and I have been working as a research assistant in my department for the past two years. Currently, I am interested in econometrics and political economy and my senior thesis examined the relationship between austerity and populism in the European Union. Apart from my academic interests, I am an avid reader of literature, both classic and modern, with some of my favorite authors being Gabriel García Márquez, Stendhal, and Umberto Eco. 
I am really thrilled about moving in Evanston as it seems like an excellent place to live, and I am also excited about starting my Ph.D. at a university like Northwestern where the research opportunities and the overall student experience are incomparable. I am a little nervous about adapting to an entirely unfamiliar environment as I am coming from a relatively small university, but on the same time I find this a tempting challenge that will help me grow as a person.  
I am looking forward to meeting everyone in person in September!

In Northwestern, I really want to increase the collaboration and be part of groups working on these projects.  I was born in Konya, which is located in the center of Turkey and it is famous with Rumi, known as one of the best-selling poets in the US.  I find myself introverted and, I think it will be challenging and great experience for me to make friendships with people from all over the world. I am a big fan of violin concertos. In Northwestern, I plan to enroll in the violin course if I get the opportunity. Since the climate of Chicago is similar to that of Istanbul, those who like cold weather like me will definitely love the city.
I love meeting new people and staying in touch, so I am adding my social media accounts. Please do not hesitate to contact me.

</div></div><p>Hi! I am Young. I will be starting off my PhD path in Statistics department, which I am really excited about. 
I am born and raised in a small town called Paju, South Korea and moved to the United States in 2016 for my undergraduate education. I was supposed to graduate in 2020, but due to two years of military service, I graduated this year. I studied mathematics in college and now I am planning to shift my gear into a more applied field and hence the statistics program :)
Because I am relatively new to the field of statistics, I am still catching up on a lot of stuffs in the field, but for now I am interested in studying statistics in a more mathematical perspective, and hopefully sublimate my understandings in mathematics and statistics into the fields of ML and time series. Of course, this is just a tentative plan, so it may change as I go along!
Besides my academic interests, I enjoy reading and working out. I played rugby for couple years in college and did CrossFit for a year. Unfortunately, I did not work out at all in my senior year, so I am planning to reignite my energy in Evanston :) Visiting the campus made me think it would be really nice to jog along the shore of the Lake Michigan! Also, I enjoy any genre as long as the book itself is good! Any book recommendations are much appreciated :)
As much as I am excited about moving to Evanston, I am also nervous about it. It feels like a new start just as when I first moved to the US six years ago. I talked to my friends about this, and our conclusion was that this may be because the East Coast and the Midwest are so far away that it feels like they are in different countries. But just as I did fine in my college year, I believe I will get along :) 
Last but not least, I would like to connect with everyone in the ELP, so feel free to add me on instagram :) It's oldmin_ko523. Unfortunately, I am back in Korea now, so I won't be able to meet y'all in-person, but I look forward to meeting you guys in September in Evanston! Take care everyone :)

</div></div><p>Hello, my name is Dokwan Kook. I am studying Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern. I was born and grew up in South Korea. It is my first time studying abroad and standing up all by myself, so I am excited and nervous at the same time. I am interested in energy storage devices, mainly batteries. I always try my best to read books, but usually, I watch youtube. Audios and videoes are more attractive than text, aren't they? I dream one day, all the journals have youtube channels and the author explains the paper using flashing lights or some fantastic visual effects. Being aside from electricity, I enjoy playing tabletop games. These days, I am kind of addicted to Mahjong, the origin of Rummikub. Also, I like to work out at the gym. I used to work out at home, but the weather is becoming hotter and hotter and I need some cool air otherwise I will be choked before I got exhausted. Another reason for going to the gym is that there was a specific limit to exercising at home. When I wanted to increase strength, because there was no weight I can lift, I tried to do more attempts of squatting, pulling up, or whatever for the same moment. It meant the time that I used for a single pose was decreasing, leading to collapsed pose. My ankle started to ache and I could certainly know this was not a good idea. I heard that the weather is quite severe at Northwestern. I am a bit worried about it because according to Google the summer in Chicago is hotter and the winter in Chicago is colder than in South Korea. Nevertheless, I am looking forward to the life at Northwestern.

</div></div><p>I'm Junqing Leng, majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I born and grew up in Beijing, China. There I finished my highschool education, then I left my hometown and traveled to Xi'an for an undergraduate education. And now, I'm leaving my homecountry, crossing the Pacific ocean, and to America for my PHD degree.
Actually, it is not my frist time been to America. I had visited UC Berkley in 2019, just before the COVID came. I can still remember the excetment, curiousness, nervousness when I got off the plane and made my first step on the ground of a foreign country on the other side of the world. And relief too, after stucking in the small seat for 20 hours with a overweight neighbor nearby.
But I'm afraid such trip can be even tougher now. Due to the COVID19, plane takets are much more precious than ever before, yet planes are much more easier to be canceled or delayed. Plus, I may have to wear a mask all the way for almost a whole day in the plane evne if I can successfully board. I also found difficulties in applying VISA these days. I've made a appointment last week and my application was checked. So many links between me and NU, and so easily they may go wrong. That really makes me nervous and anxious.
Anyway, I'm still looking forward to studying in NU. I've seen the campus photos, the michigan lake, the gym, and the wonderful labs. I think it would be a great place to experience a new lifestyle and realize my academic dream.

</div></div><p>Hello everyone! My name is Ana Luiza Vedovato, I'm an incoming PhD student in the Political Science Department at Northwestern. I'm from Brazil, born and raised. I study the relationship between conflict and state formation, and the long-term effects of these processes on state and regional development, with a regional focus on Latin America. Northwestern's Political Science department has always been my top choice, and I'm super excited about getting in! Academic rigor and faculty expertise in my area of research were some of the main reasons why I applied to Northwestern. More than that, however, Evanston/Chicago area also turned out to be one of the reasons why I have chosen to attend this program. The diverse environment and vibrant Latin American and Brazilian communities in Evanston/Chicago were super important in my decision-making. They truly helped me to feel welcome and gave me confidence that this will be a great place to live and work towards my PhD degree. Moreover, I'm a huge fan of movies, music, and books, and Chicago has great concerts, independent movie theaters, libraries and bookstores that hopefully will help me have a good work-life balance during my PhD. As for some of my concerns, the most difficult part will definitely be being away from my family and friends (and food!) in Brazil. I'm also a little worried about the weather, especially when I think about getting out of bed early in the morning during the winter. Altough I come from a very cold region in South Brazil, snow is not common here, and our winters are usually very sunny. I'm a big fan of cold weather, but people have warned me that Chicago's weather is the worst, so I'm slightly nervous about that. But in general, I'm super excited, because I'm confident that even with the cold, I'll be living my best life and attending my dream PhD program!

I am very excited of having the chance to contribute to NU's community and to collaborate with my peers and professors. I was born in México City and I have lived here all my life. Thus, I am eager of having the chance of sharing Mexico's culture with your community.
Regarding my research interests, I am fascinated by how economics provides us with the chance of elucidating, through data and models, the interactions between economic agents and how it helps us to construct valid counterfactuals that allow the examination of alternative economic realities in order to propose feasible solutions to economic issues. Particularly, my current areas of interest are econometrics, macro-finance and banking. I consider econometrics to be a powerful tool to assess and contrast the implications of economic models. With respect to macro-finance, I am fascinated by the interrelation between asset prices and business cycles, whereas in banking, I am mostly intrigued about banks' impact on the real economy and their role on monetary policy and systemic risk.
Finally, on a personal note I like to listen to music, to read, go to the movies and watch TV series.

My current research work as an MS student in India focuses on bioheat transfer. Besides research, I enjoy playing badminton. I am also an avid reader and enjoy books across various genres, including thriller, horror, detective, romance and sci-fi. Some of my all time favorites include “The Kite Runner”, “A Thousand Splendid Suns”, “A Man called Ove” and “Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo”. Needless to mention, I am a big Potterhead and have read all the Harry Potter books several times over. Being a foodie, I am so excited to try out some wonderful new cuisines of the USA in general, and  Evanston in particular. I am also an amateur photographer and can't wait to click pictures of the beautiful Evanston campus by the lake Michigan. I am also very much interested in technology and like to stay updated with the latest developments. This will be my first time traveling abroad, and I am a bit nervous about settling in as an international student. However, I am really excited to join Northwestern and hope to meet a lot of people and make a ton of new friends. I look forward to spending the most important and memorable years of my professional and personal life there.  </p></article>

</div></div><p> Hi Everyone. My name is Donghyun Sohn, and my major is computer science. I am specifically interested in a privacy-preserving database that uses database and cryptography techniques. For example, our lab recently conducted research with a Chicago hospital, analyzing patient data without revealing private information by using some cryptographic methods. I am excited to do research like this.  I was born in South Korea, and I grew up in Seoul, which is the capital of South Korea. When I was 12, I visited Canada for a few months, and at that time, many people did not know much about my country. However, over time, I am glad that many people have come to know Korea, as Korean food and music have become widely known. Except for my research field, I have two big personal interests.The first one is sports. I love to play sports and watch sports games. I usually play soccer, and recently I started to learn tennis. I hope I can keep playing tennis at Northwestern too. During my break time, I watched sports games, especially soccer and the NBA. When I watched the NBA in Korea, I always dreamed of watching the NBA player in front of my eye. I am excited to go to the United Center and watch some Chicago bulls players.  I am also interested in fashion. I admire some people who dress well. Therefore, I followed some fashion people on Instagram and got inspiration. I prefer to wear clothes neatly with balanced color. I'm a little worried because the winter weather in Chicago is super cold, and it's hard to get dressed, but I'm also looking forward to living in a new city.
I love meeting new people, so I am adding my social media accounts. Feel free to contact me.

Department of Study: In which academic department will you study at Northwestern?

Something in-between school of Engineering and Communication

Country of Origin: Where were you born? Where did you grow up?

Russia, St. Petersburg

Profile: Tell us something about yourself so that we can get to know you.  Some ideas of things to write about: What are your interests in research, and what are your personal interests?  What are you looking forward to about living in Evanston or Chicago? What are you excited about as you think about coming to Northwestern? What are you nervous about? 

I used to like Computational Social Science as a field, but currently I am slightly lost. I really hope that Evanston will be less rainy and cold than my hometown, but my hopes are not that high. Also, I have no idea how expensive is to live in Evanston, and I am moderately scared that after a few months in USA i will be classified as traitor by Russian government and will never be able to see my friends and family. I hope that NW is a place with lots of expertise at least in my tiny field, and I will have a chance to learn from the greatest. 

that is me in somewhere in Kazakhstan</p></article>

Even though my undergraduate major was Medical Laboratory Science (which heavily focuses on the clinical aspect of laboratories), basic biological research appeals to me more. Outside of the lab life, I am interested in photography. These days I am experementing with film photography.
I am looking forward to the reputable education system that Northwestern has to offer. Chicago and Evanston also seem to be fascinating cities with tons of things to do. However, I do sometimes concern about the American academia culture, as well as the safety of everyday life (all the news I saw on reddit really did not help with my anxiety).

With the help of some powerful techniques, I found that these interneurons may mediate the correlation between excitation-inhibition changes. In other words, this kind of interneuron functions like a bridge over the gap between two opposite signals in our brain. Currently I can not understand the physiological significance of my results, neither can I figure out the microcircuits organizations underlying such regulations, but it's really fun when you get some unexpected result from experiments, I think my research experience in undergraduate school has really motivated me to pursue a doctoral training in the neuroscience.
Outside of the lab, I'm a super fan of Nintendo games. I've been playing Animal Crossing and Monster Hunter Rise for hundreds of hours, if you are looking for a mate to build the island or hunt monsters, please feel free to friend me on your switch, my code is SW-2818-2241-8317. Besides, I've practiced painting for nearly 20 years, so I'm looking forward to meeting someone who also enjoys fine art and would like to visit art museums when available.

</div></div><p>Hello Everyone! My name's Mark Zhao and I'm an incoming PhD student in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences. I was born in Xiamen, China and had lived there for 18 years until I moved to California for my undergraduate study in 2017. I attended UC Santa Barbara, majoring in Physics and Statistics, and enjoyed the chill vibe there a lot. After graduating and before committing to my PhD study at Northwestern, I decided to take a gap year, where I've spent my time exploring several cities in China while doing internships in the field of quantitative finance. I have a wide range of personal interests. I enjoy gastronomy and all that defines it, including preparing food, studying food culture, and dining experiences. I play the piano and guitar, with the sole purpose of self-enjoyment. I love films, theaters, and books that pull me out from reality and allow me to live a different life, even just momentarily. I love traveling, or even just wandering around the streets, by myself, or together with loved ones. Several things I'm looking forward to the most at Evanston/Chicago: the gorgeous Lake Michigan, the Jazz bars, the musicals, and food. If anyone wants to connect, I can be found on Facebook (Mark Zhao) and WeChat (GemuetlicherReisball). Looking forward to meeting everyone!

</div></div><p>This is Jiafeng Zhu. You can simply call me Jay. I am first-year Biostatistics PhD student in the school of Medicine, and is literally the first generation of this track. I was born and grew in China. I worked as a Research Associate for three years and plan to start a new chapter in my life. 
I am interested in learning new statistical methods and playing with data. I like to play basketball and video games, and watch all kinds of sports. I am looking forward to enjoying the view of Michigan lake and watching games of Chicago Bulls and Northwestern Wildcat football/basketball games in the arena. I have been hearing about the high quality of education at Northwestern and I cannot wait to meet those talent professors and classmates in the classroom. It is also a bit nervous that I am not sure if I can perfectly complete the study. Uncertainty can be painful but also fascinating!
